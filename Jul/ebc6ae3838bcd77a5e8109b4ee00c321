The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has declared Tuesday, as a work-free day in the state as the deadline for registration of voters for the 2023 general elections comes to a close. The governor said this in a statement issued in Abeokuta on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin. Abiodun said, the “one-day public holiday is to provide a window for all workers in the state, who have either lost their cards, not registered or who might need to travel to their wards, local government areas and constituencies to perfect their Permanent Voters Registration or transfer their cards, where necessary, to enable them to participate in the next general elections”. “As an inclusive, participatory and accountable government, the role of PVCs to the citizens cannot be overemphasised. The governor, therefore, urged all eligible adults to seize the opportunity of the holiday to go home to their different wards and constituencies to search for their Registered Voter Cards, fill the claims and objections forms and transfer the PVCs where necessary.
