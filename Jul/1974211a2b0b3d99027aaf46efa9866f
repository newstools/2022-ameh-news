The statement read in part, “Nigeria has again demonstrated its commitment to honouring its debt obligations as at when due by the redemption of the $300m Diaspora Bond which matured on June 27, 2022. “The Diaspora Bond was issued on June 27, 2017, for a tenor of five years in the International Capital Market and the proceeds were used to partly finance the deficit in the 2017 Appropriation Act. “In addition to the objective of raising funds for the Government, it was an initiative to avail the Nigerian Diaspora the opportunity to invest in their home country.
