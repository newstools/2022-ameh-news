A London-based medical doctor, Obinna Obeta has been docked for allegedly conniving with Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice to facilitate the travel of Ukpo Nwamini David for kidney harvesting. Recall that the Metropolitan Police had on June 21 arrested the couple for allegedly planning to have David’s kidney removed for their daughter Sonia who was suffering from kidney failure. David who earlier claimed to be 15 years old, on 5 May 2022, presented himself at Staines Police Station alleging that he was transported to the UK by Ekweremadus for his kidney to be removed. On the other hand, Obeta was alleged to have conspired with the former Deputy Senate President to arrange or facilitate the travel of David with a view to exploiting him through organ harvesting. The 50-year-old medical doctor of Hillbeck Close, Southwark, southeast London had according to reports, appeared at Bexley Magistrates’ Court on 13 July. David who earlier claimed to be a minor had also confessed to the UK court that he is 21-year-old. Ekweremad and his wife are still in custody.
