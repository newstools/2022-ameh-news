Dr. Jamoh said “Congratulations to the 472 staff of the Agency whose promotions have been ratified by the NIMASA Governing Board, It is my expectation that this development will serve as a morale booster as you collectively rededicate yourselves to the delivery of our core mandates”. “We remain dedicated to ensuring staff welfare is at the forefront in order to encourage the hard work and dedication that our staff are known for is maintained and built upon going forward. Suffice to say that the promotional exercise was rigorous to ensure our high standards are maintained.”  “On our part as Executive Management, we will continue to ensure that staff promotions are conducted as and when due as part of our commitment to human capacity development in the Agency thereby ensuring positive contributions to the nation’s economic diversification drive”.
