The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has announced the suspension of Dana Airlines’ air transport licence (ATL) and air operator certificate (AOC) indefinitely. The NCAA made this known in a statement signed by Musa Nuhu, its Director-General. Dana’s operating licences were suspended after the authority “discovered that the airline is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations”. According to the NCAA, the suspension takes effect from midnight on Wednesday, July 20, 2022. Part of the statement read: “The suspension was made pursuant to Section 35(2), 3(b), and (4) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3(a)(1) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations, 2015. “The decision is the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the airline by the authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the airline’s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.” The NCAA acknowledged the negative effect of the action on the Airline’s passengers and the travelling public but sought their understanding, stressing that the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.
