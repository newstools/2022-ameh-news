  The Federal Government has declared Monday and Tuesday July 11 and 12, 2022 as public holidays to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebration. While felicitating with Muslim faithful, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, urged Nigerians to report suspicious movement around them to security operatives. The minister stated this in a statement by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Dr Shuaib Belgore, on Thursday in Abuja. “While wishing Muslims a happy Eid-el-Kabir celebration, the minister urged Nigerians to take responsibility by reporting any suspicious individuals and criminal activities they observed around them to law enforcement agencies with the use of N-Alerts application that has been designed to mitigate security challenges with prompt response from security agencies: as soon as you ‘See Something Do N-Alerts’, most especially during this festival,” the statement read in part. He, however, called on Muslims in the country to use the celebration to pray for peace in the country.
