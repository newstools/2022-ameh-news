THE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board on Thursday pegged the deadline for the 2022 admissions for December 31, 2022,. This is as the board also stated that it would no longer accept A’Level results by the National Business and Technical Education Board for Direct Entry admissions. These were disclosed during the 2022 policy meeting organised by the board in Abuja. The JAMB Registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, said, “The Minister of Education has approved that the NABTEB A’Level GCE will no longer be recognised as a qualification for Direct Entry from 2022. However, all those who have already obtained it prior to this date will be able to use it. “For the cut-off, 140 have been approved as the minimum benchmark for admissions in universities; 120 for polytechnics and 100 for colleges of education. The deadline for the 2022 admissions has been agreed to be December 31, 2022.” While giving further statistics of the 2022 examination, Oloyede noted that 378,639 scored above 200; a total of 520,596 candidates scored 190 and above; 704,991 scored 180 and above; 934,103 scored 170 and above; 1,192,057 scored 160 and above.
