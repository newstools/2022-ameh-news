Alhaji Aliyu Marafa, the Emir of Birnin Yandoto of Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State has been suspended by Governor Bello Matawalle for conferring a chieftaincy title on a banditry kingpin, Ado Alero. The banditry kingpin, Ado Alero, was turbaned as the Sarkin Fulani on Saturday by the Emir. Report has it that the decision of conferring the title on Ado Alero was based on the major role he played during a recent peace process locally arranged between the emirate and the bandits terrorising Tsafe Local Government Area. Kabiru Balarebe, the Secretary to the State Government, in a statement, announced the suspension of the emir with immediate effect, saying that the State government distanced itself from all the processes. The State government, however, assigned Alh. Mahe Garba Marafa, the District Head of ‘Yandoto, to take charge of the affairs of the emirate. The government, according to the statement, also raised a six-man committee chaired by Yahaya Chado Gora to investigate the circumstances leading to the action of the emir.
