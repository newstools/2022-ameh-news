With the rising inflation rate in Nigeria, the latest data by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed that money supply in the economy recorded the highest growth in 10years, gaining 9.14 per cent or N4.46trillion Year-till-Date (YtD) to N48.87 trillion in June of this year. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) last Thursday in its Consumer Price Index (CPI) disclosed that Nigeria’s inflation rate hits a 65-month high of 18.6per cent in June 2022 from 17.71 per cent in May. Inflation had opened January 2022 at 15.60 per cent. CPI measures the average change over time in price of good and services consumed by general public for day-to-day living i.e it measures the inflation rate. The significant increase in money supply reflects increasing demand for cash by general public caused by continued rise in prices of goods and services, evidenced by the fifth consecutive months rise in the inflation this year. The surge in money supply is driven by increased borrowing by the Federal government and commercial banks’ lending to the private sector propelled by the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The “Credit and Money” supply data by the apex bank revealed that money supply (M3) grew by 23.68 per cent to N48.87trillion in June 2022 from N39.51trillion reported June 2021. Money supply is defined as total stock of money in an economy comprising currency (notes and coins) and deposit with commercial banks in Nigeria and it consist of broad money (M2) and narrow money (M1).
