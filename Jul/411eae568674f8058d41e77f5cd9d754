The Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Friday evening attended the Dunamis International Gospel Centre vigil. The entire church went agog after Obi was introduced by the wife of the Senior Pastor, Paul Enenche, Becky. Addressing members of the church, Becky Enenche said: “And we also have tonight, Mr Peter Obi who has joined for the service this evening.” The entire church erupted into clapping and screaming as they cheered him. While the cheering was on, Enenche himself walked to Obi and shook his hand. The former Anambra State Governor is one of the leading contenders for the 2023 presidential election. Recently, Obi defected from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to LP, where he clinched the party’s presidential ticket.
