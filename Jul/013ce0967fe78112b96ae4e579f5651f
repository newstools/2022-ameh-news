Church leaders have expressed disappointment over the prolonged industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. They said the country’s future was now bleak with students roaming the streets aimlessly everyday. The leaders then enjoined ASUU and other academic unions to immediately resolve the issues in the interest of the students and the future of the country. The Fellowship of Leaders and Ministers of Bible-believing Churches, led by Pastor Abel Aiyedogbon, while speaking with newsmen in Ilorin on Monday, observed that the country may be in jeopardy if the youths were not properly trained and prepared for expected roles in the country. He said, “As a body and stakeholders to the destinies of our children, we appeal to the parties concerned, especially the Federal Government to quickly resolve the ASUU crisis.” He noted that the students involved were the future leaders of the nation and if they were not prepared for such roles as expected, the future of the country may be in jeopardy. He added that “today is the womb of tomorrow, what Nigerians do with the nation today would determine how strong the country will be tomorrow”, adding that “the Nigeria of tomorrow is certainly going to be what the ruling class of today organises it to be.” The church leaders said that the prolonged strike had shown insensitivity on part of the nation’s policy makers and all the stakeholders involved, adding that the plight of university students who have been at the receiving end over the years need to be considered.
