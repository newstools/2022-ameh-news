The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is planning to compromise and sabotage the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process in Saturday’s governorship election in Osun State. PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, on Friday, said the APC was deploying billions of naira to compromise some security agencies and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials to intimidate voters and manipulate the electoral process to favour its candidate, Governor Gboyega Oyetola. It alleged that some INEC and security officials have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and give cover for “APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme”. PDP’s statement partly read, “The said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme. “The PDP alerts of a leaked report of how the APC released N20million and N15million respectively to two top police officers; N10million to four Assistant Inspector General of Police, N5million each to four Commissioners of Police, N3million each to 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, N2million each to 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police to compromise the electoral process. “The PDP calls on the Inspector General of Police and the Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu to take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.”
