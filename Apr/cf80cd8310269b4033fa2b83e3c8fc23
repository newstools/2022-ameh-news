Brand Journalists’ Association of Nigeria (BJAN) on Thursday ended the winning streak of CMC Connect in an invite only game. The event organised by CMC Connect, a perception management firm, is a once in a month invite only game put together to create a work place balance among staff of the organisation and to deepen the relationship with their visitors. Tagged April Aerobics, the event held at the Quadrangle, CMC Connect’s GRA, Ikeja office, saw brand journalists win 3-2 in the overall games thereby ending the winning streak of the host, who had never been beaten on their turf prior to the April meet. The meet is held every first Thursday in the month between 7:30 and 11am.
The April event started with a road walk within the GRA, Ikeja vicinity and aerobics to relax the muscles.
The games kicked off with women’s lime race followed by men’s relay race and men’s football match with a heavily depleted BJAN team holding the more energetic CMC Connect side. The match ended 5-1 in favour of the host. The victory however, could not deter the visitors from emerging the overall winner through a shoot in the net game which Clara Chinwe Okoro, BJAN Chairman coasted home successfully. For emerging victorious, Brand Journalists Association of Nigeria (BJAN) was awarded a victory cup in remembrance of the game and also a ‘bragging right’ for ending their host’s clean sheet. According to Raheem Olabode an Executive Director at CMC Connect, the game is one of the company’s ways of creating a work place balance among the staff. Members of Team BJAN who made the event were, Clara Chinwe Okoro, Adedayo Odulaja, Amechi Obiakpu, Godwin Anyebe, Dele Adeleye, Akeem Salau, Melvin Udosen and Lukman Ishau.
