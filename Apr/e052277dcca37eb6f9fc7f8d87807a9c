 The Presidency has reacted to the call for an interim government to be set up after the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 to enable the drafting of a new constitution. Aare Afe Babalola, the founder and Chancellor, Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, ABUAD, had told the Buhari administration to suspend the 2023 general election and appoint an interim government instead. According to Babalola, this interim government will use its time in office to draft a new constitution that is truly people-oriented. He said the new constitution, to be produced within six months, would tackle insecurity, economic, political and other excruciating ills bedevilling the nation. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), made the call amidst a myriad of security, economic challenges and other issues threatening the existence of the country. But reacting to this, a Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina, who appeared on Channels Television on Friday, said the Nigerian Constitution does not give permission to form an interim government. “To the best of my unlearned knowledge, it is not in our constitution for an interim government to be set up,” Adesina said.
