Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday insisted that Russia is committing genocide in his country. Zelensky described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as involving “the torture of the whole nation,” adding that they wanted to destroy all Ukrainians. Speaking to CBS News through a translator, Zelensky said Ukrainians did not want to be subdued by Russia and were being exterminated as a result. Asked whether Russia’s actions constitute genocide, Zelensky said: “Indeed, this is genocide. The elimination of the whole nation and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. “This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities.” This comes after images had earlier emerged of Ukrainian civilians lying dead on the streets of Bucha, with residents saying the victims were killed by Russian soldiers without any apparent provocation. Bucha’s mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, had said that more than 300 residents had been killed. France President, Emmanuel Macron had sympathized with Ukrainians, describing the images from Bucha as “unbearable,” adding that Russian authorities would have to answer for war crimes. The war between Russia and Ukraine started in February this year. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had ordered the invasion of Ukraine due to political differences between both nations.
