A self-acclaimed disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, Simon Ekpa has alleged that former President Goodluck Jonathan’s auto crash on Wednesday evening was an attempted assassination. Recall that Jonathan escaped death while returning from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. However, two of his aides did not survive the accident. But, Ekpa in a thread via his Twitter page, claimed that the accident was a plan to kill the former President. He warned Jonathan to change the position of his car during convoy movement and add three more similar cars to his convoy for more protection. His tweet read, “Goodluck Jonathan’s involvement in an accident yesterday was an attempted assassination. The plan to assassinate Goodluck Jonathan is ongoing by the terrorist government. “Can the security agents, the road safety give us details of what they believe led to the accident yesterday? “Those planning to kill Goodluck Jonathan will not stop. Last time the gunmen invaded his house. President Jonathan must change the position of his car during the convoy”s movement, also add 3 more similar cars to his convoys. This is very important to do this for the coming months.” Meanwhile, Jonathan has mourned with the families of his two aides who died in the crash. He expressed deep sympathy as he disclosed that two other officers in his security team are receiving treatment in the hospital.
