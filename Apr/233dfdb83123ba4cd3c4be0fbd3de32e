Justice Boma Diepiri of Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt has fixed May 11 for hearing of the rights enforcement suit by Chairman of Ibeto Cement Cletus Ibeto against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and a businessman, Chief Daniel Chukwudozie. Justice Diepiri, who earlier fixed Monday for the hearing, adjourned due to an application by Ibeto’s lawyer Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN) for more time to reply counter-affidavits filed by the respondents. EFCC’s lawyer Simon Ibekwute and the second respondent’s, Patrick Ikwueto (SAN), urged the court to give them time to reply to the applicant’s motions. Ibeto sued the EFCC and Chukwudozie, seeking to prevent the anti-graft agency from investigating allegations of fraud bordering on obtaining by false pretence N4.8 billion, forgery and criminal breach of trust brought against him by Dozzy Oil and Gas. He is asking the court to declare that his harassment by the respondents is unlawful, to restrain EFCC from arresting him and order them to pay him N500 million damages for his arrest.
