Aston Villa legend, Gabby Agbonlahor has slammed Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger over one of the goals scored by Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on Tuesday. Agbonlahor accused Rudiger of saving his legs, as he did not want to wreck a summer move away from Stamford Bridge. The German defender could have stopped Benzema from winning the ball just before the Frenchman scored into an empty net to make it 3-1 for Real Madrid. Agbonlahor believes Rudiger was conscious of not getting injured. “I know it was a bad pass on Mendy, but Rudiger’s tackle was someone who didn’t want to get injured,” Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. “It was like he’s got a move ready and he didn’t want to hurt himself,” he added. Rudiger’s contract runs out in a few months’ time and the 29-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Real and PSG this summer.
