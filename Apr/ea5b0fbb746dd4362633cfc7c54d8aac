Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries has disclosed the reasons he ignored Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, as his spiritual father. Suleman said he ignored Adeboye as his spiritual father because he was loyal to the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa. Addressing his members, the clergyman also disclosed how the General Overseer of RCCG affected his life during his early days. Suleman said his mentality changed after he listened to Pastor Adeboye’s ministration and miracles. According to Suleman: “In 1992, I came to Auchi to visit my father as a believer. By then, I was only preaching in minor places. One day, I was told about a program in a church. Pastor Adeboye was preaching during the program, and he knelt down to pray. When he got up, he called God ‘my daddy.’ I got angry at first; then he said again that we had a mad man outside. “Immediately they brought the mad man, he said to us, let’s worship ‘my daddy’; after the worship, the mad man got healed. The funny thing was Adeboye was very calm when saying this. I was just speechless because I never knew God’s plan for me through him. “After the program, I didn’t bother following him up because the late Benson Idahosa was my spiritual father in the lord, and I can’t betray him. My father in the lord died in 1998 in March, and I was now fatherless. So another crusade where over 4 million people (lekki 98) gathered, God used Pastor Adeboye greatly with the word of knowledge. I was still observing. “About 2006, I went into prayer, and something happened. I wrote names of pastors around the world that I wanted to be like. Funny enough, the late Benson Idahosa was number 10. God left others and answered the one about Pastor Adeboye. Why? I don’t stand in one spot while preaching, but pastor Adeboye stands in one spot. The holy spirit told me to pattern my ministry with Pastor Adeboye. I became calm while preaching because of Pastor Adeboye”.
