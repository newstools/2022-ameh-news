 Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has hinted that President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the support to effectively fight insecurity. Mohammed said Buhari wants to tackle insecurity but lacks the support. The Governor spoke in Bauchi while addressing all the local government chairmen in the State yesterday. He offered to collaborate with the Federal Government to manage the situation, as he revealed that one of the local government areas in the State was recently attacked by bandits. Mohammed urged the council chairmen to ensure they secured their communities. According to Mohammed: “It is unacceptable for the Federal Government to continue to say they cannot secure this country, our communities. “We have the resources to do it. I really pity our father, the President and Commander-in-Chief. Because he really wants to do it, but he has not been supported. “I as a Governor, head of a sub-national administration, I’m ready to work with the Federal Government to make sure we secure our state and country. It is our collective responsibility.”
