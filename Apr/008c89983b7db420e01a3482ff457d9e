The Department of State Services, DSS, has continued to refuse Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, change his clothes. Kanu’s Counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, claimed that the DSS refused all efforts by family members of the IPOB leader to change his clothes. He disclosed this in a statement on Thursday, after a routine meeting with the IPOB leader at the DSS headquarters in Abuja. Ejiofor insisted that the DSS refusal was a blunt violation of court orders. The counsel also disclosed that his client has been denied proper medical attention in the DSS facility. According to Ejiofor, Kanu’s health is gradually deteriorating. The statement reads partly: “Consistent with the usual practice of the DSS personnel, they have continued to rebuff every attempt at ensuring that Onyendu has a change of clothing. The lawless DSS personnel bluntly rejected all clothing brought by our client’s relatives, again, in clear violation of the extant orders of the court. “In line with the court’s directives, we meticulously ensured that the new clothing met the specifications of the court, and consequently beat the DSS to their games, so that by Friday, they will have no excuse to give to the court for deliberately flouting the positive orders of the court. “We also observed with dismay, as Onyendu’s impeccable account revealed, that he is not receiving proper medical attention in the custody of the DSS as his health condition is gradually deteriorating.” Kanu is billed to appear before Justice Binta Nyako-Federal High court today, Friday. Justice Nyako is expected to rule on Kanu’s fundamental human rights violation suit against the Nigerian Government. The IPOB leader has been in DSS detention after he was arrested in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria in June, 2021.
