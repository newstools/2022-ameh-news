The President and founder of a non-governmental organisation, Enemona Josh Humanitarian Foundation, Gabriel Onoja, has been arrested by the police. Earlier on Thursday, there were reports that Onoja was abducted by gunmen in his house on Wada Road, Lokoja, around 10.30am. But the Executive Director of the NGO, Williams Illah, in a statement, said his whereabouts had been established. Illah, while faulting the manner he was arrested which he described as uncivilised, said it was over a business transaction between him and his partners. “At the moment, it is confirmed that our founder is in the safe hands of security agents where certain harmonisation of business agreement is expected between him and his partners,” he added. As of the time of filing this report, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP William Aya, had yet to respond to calls and text messages from our correspondent on the incident.
