The Manufacturers Confidence Index (MCCI) is an index designed by a group under aegis of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) comprised of over 250 members companies to measure changes in quarterly manufacturing activities in relation to movement in the macroeconomy and Government policies.  According to MAN, the Index is therefore barometer used to aggregate the views of 400 CEOs of manufacturing companies on changes in the economy. The standard diffusion factors considered in the MCCI processes include the Current Business Condition, Business Condition for the next three months, Current Employment Condition (Rate of Employment), Employment Condition for the next three months and Production Level for the next three months.   MCCI in the report released for the fourth quarter of 2021 showed that there was a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic economic and manufacturing operating environment buttressed by marginal recovery of some key manufacturing indicators. The index also measured Sectoral Group specific confidence on the economy using the same diffusion factors such as Business Condition, Employment Condition and Production level.  Figure ‘ii’ presents the perspectives of MAN CEOs in the ten Sectoral Groups.          The Index scores in Figure ‘ii’ shows that there is growing confidence in the economy across all sectoral group in the period under review despite prevailing economic and health challenges.  All the Index scores were above the 50 points which is the benchmark, though in differing magnitudes.  Index for Food, Beverage and Tobacco (FBT)sectoral group increased by 2.8 points to 58.7points in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 55.9 points recorded in the preceding quarter.   Similarly, Index for Chemical and Pharmaceutical Products group increased by 1.8 points in the quarter under review from 60.3 points obtained in the preceding quarter.  In the same vein, Index for Motor Vehicle and Miscellaneous Assembly maintain positive growth reading of 51.3 points in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 50.7 points obtained in the preceding quarter; thus, indicating 0.6 points increase over the period. The trend therefore generally indicates increasing level of confidence of manufacturers operating in these sectoral groups in the economy.  According to the Association during the fieldwork of the report, manufacturers identified numerous challenges that affected manufacturing operation, particularly in the quarter under review. The ranking of issues by CEOs in order of intensity include high cost of local and imported raw materials, insecurity within the industrial areas, shortage of skilled manpower, high cost of transportation, inconsistency in government policies and foreign exchange difficulty.  The report further stated that Manufacturing performance is still below the mark, notwithstanding the marginal improvement in the operating environment during the quarter under review, as the sector is still plagued by numerous familiar constraints.  Some of these challenges enumerated by manufacturers are clearly presented in this report.  Consequently, in order to improve the performance of the sector, Government needs to intentionally put in place mechanism that will address these challenges permanently by considering and implementing the following recommendation:         Other recommendations include the following:  Although, the resort stressed that changes in almost all manufacturing indicators as measured in this report are still not as desired, the performance in the fourth quarter is better than what obtained in the preceding quarter.  The resilience of manufacturers, the seasonal transactions and passive policy support sustained manufacturing in the quarter despite the prevalence of familiar and emerging excessive tax related challenges faced by manufacturers. Overall, the sector recorded a mixed grilled performance occasioned by meagre improvement in the operating environment indices and macroeconomic ambience evidenced by the high points, which cumulatively triggered the increase in the aggregate MCCI score for the quarter to 55.4 points from 54.0 points recording the preceding quarter.
