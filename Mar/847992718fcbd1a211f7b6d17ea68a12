The management of Lafarge Africa Plc has released its 2021Full Year audited financials yesterday. The report showed that 2021Full Year performance recorded PAT grew by 65.4% year-on-year to NGN51.00 billion while EPS settled at NGN3.17per share up by 65.4% year-on-year. The company’s earnings performance was bolstered by the combined impact of topline growth, higher margins and moderation in finance cost. According to the report, the company has proposed a final dividend of NGN1.00 per share same as in 2020Full Year, implying a dividend yield of 7.3% based on the closing price of NGN26.00 on March 1 2022. Analysts note that Q4 of 2021 numbers are not directly comparable with Q4 of 2020 due to the reclassification of certain distribution costs on its products from cost of sales to selling and marketing expenses.  Other indicators that showed are revenue which grew by 27.1% year-on-year in 2021Full Year, on the back of improvements in cement sales also grow by 26.1% year-on-year; representing 97.3% share of revenue and aggregate and concrete sales up by 61.5% year-on-year; also representing 2.6% share of revenue. Though management is yet to provide details on the driver of the cement sales growth, analysts believe the double-digit growth was supported by strong demand from the private sector, underpinned by the recovery in activities in the real estate sector 2021Full Year growth of 2.3% as against contraction of 9.2% in 2020Full Year. As observed with the industry leader (DANGCEM), analysts believe LAFARGE’s revenue also received a boost from the substantial increase in price per tonne of cement up by 18.1% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2021.  Nevertheless, Gross margin declined marginally by 15bps to 58.9% in 2021Full Year, due to the slightly higher increase in the cost of sales but ex-depreciation grows by 27.6% year-on-year compared to revenue up by 27.1% year-on-year. The rise in the cost of sales was driven mainly by the variable cost grow by 45.5% year-on-year and maintenance cost  by72.5% year-on-year components as we believe the increase in these cost lines was due to the pass-through impact of the local currency’s devaluation on energy cost, essential materials such as gypsum, and spare parts associated with maintaining plants.  Despite the increase in the cost of sales, EBITDA rose by 29.6% year-on-year on the back of favourable price/volume mix and gains from its operational efficiencies evidenced by the moderation in OPEX/sales ratio declined by 25.8% in 2021Full Year as against 26.8% in 2020Full Year. Sequentially, EBITDA margin strengthened to 33.4% in 2021Full Year 2020Full Year stood at32.7%.  Meanwhile, earnings were also lifted by the moderation in finance cost declined by 45.7% year-on-year in 2021Full Year, reflecting gains from the reduction in gross debt declined by 53.2% year-on-year to NGN23.28 billion in 2021Full Year when compared with NGN49.73 billion in 2020Full Year. In the meantime, the growth in finance income grow by 48.0% year-on-year was supported by FX gains of NGN1.18 billion, which was absent in 2020Full Year.  “PBT grew by 65.7% year-on-year to NGN62.25 billion in 2021Full Year. Following the increase in tax expense which stood at NGN11.25 billion in 2021Full Year as against NGN6.73 billion in 2020Full Year, PAT grew by 65.4% year-on-year to NGN51.00 billion.”  Commenting on the results: Analysts at Cordros Research said “we like that the company sustained profitability for the third consecutive year after recording pre-tax losses in the 2016-2018 financial years. According to them, the post-tax profit of NGN51.00 billion is also the highest since 2014 which stood at NGN33.82 billion declined, suggesting the divestment from its loss-making South African subsidiary in 2019 and the execution of its debt restructuring programme have continued to yield positive results.  Looking ahead, “we are concerned about the sustainability of the current pricing environment, given that cement producers have raised prices significantly over the past two years. We believe guidance on Lafarge’s borrowing plans given the very low leverage of debt/equity of 0.06x as of 2021Full Year will be at the front burner of discussion at the conference call (date yet to be announced).
