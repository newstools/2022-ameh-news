The Pentagon has condemned a Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov’s refusal to rule out the use of nuclear weapons during the Ukraine conflict. Recall that Peskov had told CNN International on Tuesday that nuclear weapons could be used if Russia faced an “existential threat.” Russia currently has the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear warheads. Reacting to the development, the Department of Defense spokesman, John Kirby, said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous.” “It’s not the way a responsible nuclear power should act,” Kirby told reporters. Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture.” “We monitor this as best as we can every day,” he said. The war between Russia and Ukraine started last month and many casualties have already been recorded. Russian President, Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues.
