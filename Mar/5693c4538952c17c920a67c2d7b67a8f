The Federal Government has said that some Nigerians who are trapped following the crisis between Russia and Ukraine are not willing to return to the country. This was made known on Monday by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, during a meeting with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, in Abuja. He, however, said the government would on Wednesday commence the process of evacuation for those who are willing to return. He said: “We hope to start evacuation hopefully Wednesday, although some do not want to come back. We are doing everything possible to ensure that come Wednesday, we will dispatch planes for evaluation.” The Minister told Gbajabiamila that the government had provided accommodations and other vital needs for Nigerians who were taking refuge in the neighbouring countries pending their evacuation. The Speaker, who lamented the ordeal of Nigerians trapped in the warring countries, also pledged that the House would give its support in accelerating their evacuation. “It is the moral thing to do. Therefore, if there is anything the House can do to accelerate their (Nigerians) safe return, let us know,” he said. The face-off between Russia and Ukraine entered sixth day today, with world leaders calling for ceasefire.
