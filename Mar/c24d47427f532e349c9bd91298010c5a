The management of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, has suspended the Students’ Union election amid violence which broke out between two different groups. In a memo signed by the Dean, Students’ Affairs, Dr Oluyemi Omotosho (Jnr), the management said it was imperative to put on hold the Students’ Union election due to the violence that trailed the campaigns. According to the statement, “When the ban on politics was lifted on March 21, 2022, by ISEC, everybody was hoping for a violence-free election until two presidential aspirants, Akeem Kabiru Olawale (Kaybright) and Edward Ayodeji Michael (Edward) commenced their campaigns on March 24, 2022. “The two groups clashed and violence erupted, leading to serious injuries on many students. A cutlass welding supporter was caught after using the cutlass to injure one student and another student with a gun was apprehended. “The management reviewed the security challenges in the Federal Polytechnic Ede campuses and Ede community and took the following decisions; “That the 2021/2022 SUL election is hereby suspended until further notice, when the security challenges improve to prevent the loss of lives and properties. “The arrested students that are involved in criminal activities should be investigated. “Students have been directed to start preparing for their second semester examination commencing from 4th April, 2022.” Reacting, the Student’ Union President, Adekunle Jimoh (Adebam), said the Students’ Union under his leadership was not carried along in the decision taken by the management. Jimoh revealed that he had instructed the Public Relations Officer of the union to issue a rejoinder against the memo since it did not know anything about it. “I will be meeting the management on Monday. The management cannot because of what happened stop the election. We are going to have our election. “Instead of stopping the election, the two aspirants involved in the violence should be disqualified,” he said.
