The Federal Government has announced that fully vaccinated travellers coming into Nigeria will no longer be required to take a pre-departure PCR COVID-19 test. The Chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee, Boss Mustapha made this known on Monday during a briefing of the PSC on the revision of International Travel Protocols. But passengers, who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, are still expected to take a COVID-19 PCR test 48 hrs before departure, or undertake a day 2 and day 7 test on arrival. Mustapha noted that such passengers under this category are expected to pay for their PCR tests through the Federal Government’s travel platform. He added that fully vaccinated passengers will also not be charged for rapid antigen tests at the airport.
