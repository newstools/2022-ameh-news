The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has described the Monday’s attack on a Kaduna-bound train and the frequent attacks in the region as unacceptable. ACF expressed shock over the attack on the train, saying that as custodian of the welfare and integrity of the North, it is tired of crying out on the issue of security and other challenges bedeviling the region. In a statement issued by its Secretary General, Malam Murtala Aliyu, the forum enjoined the Federal and State governments to rise to the occasion and revisit their security architecture, with a view to protecting the lives and property of the citizens. According to the forum, banditry and terrorism have excised the Northern region. According to the statement, “The ACF commiserates with the souls lost, sympathises with the wounded and prays for an end to such ugly menace, not only in Kaduna State, but all over the federation. “Moreover, the fact that both air and rail systems, out of Kaduna, have been compromised, it is to be expected that a sensitive government should protect the only route (Kaduna/Abuja highway).” The ACF cautioned over what it termed unnecessary attacks that stretches the security and economic services in the country, stressing that “one can easily recall how the lives and economy of the Borno, Zamfara, Sokoto, Niger, and Kaduna (Birnin Gwari and Southern parts of Kaduna), were damaged, and now, taking their turn on the infrastructure.” The statement prevailed on AZMAN and Air Peace airlines to have a rethink over their resolve to suspend flights to the Kaduna International Airport, saying such action contributes, negatively, to the problems. The Forum called on all northerners to remain positive and law-abiding, and not relent in their resilience and hope towards making lives better
