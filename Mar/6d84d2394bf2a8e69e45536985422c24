Former Senate President and a two-term governor of Kwara State, Bukola Saraki says President Muhammadu Buhari has grossly failed the Northern Nigeria and the country in general. Saraki, whose Presidential Campaigns train visited Kano, Thursday night, said President Buhari promised to give Nigerians power but the country was now worse off in energy supply. “The President said he will provide effective security of lives and properties, today, Nigerians cannot even travel to a closer town without being in fear and uncertain of what will happen to them,” he said. The former Senate President, who was represented by the Campaign Director, “Bukola Saraki Presidential Campaign Directorate”, Professor Iyorwuese Hagber said they surveyed the number of people contesting the presidency in 2023 and critically looked at the performances of APC/President Muhammadu Buhari, and agreed that only Bukola Saraki would salvage the country from the ineptitude government that would be out by 2023. “Bukola Saraki would certainly take over the government, organize massive reforms, restructure the mentality of Nigerians, bring back justice, because justice has been compromised by the APC regime, which does not respect separation of powers. “The judiciary and the legislative arms have all come under the control of the executive,” he said. Professor Hagba said, “today, Nigeria is greatly divided along tribe and religion, that is why something urgently need to be done to salvage it. “Nigeria is the poorest nation on earth today. They have failed to make Nigerians happy, we are sad and disgusted. Bukola Saraki who is not corrupt would do the magic and wipe out our tears”. Speaking earlier, the Kano PDP Chairman, Shehu Sagagi, warned the PDP National leadership against allowing Kwankwaso decamp from the party.
