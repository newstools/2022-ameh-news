Ahead of the national convention of the All Progressives Congress, the chairman of the mainstream faction of the party in Enugu State, Comrade Adolphus Ude has told a former national vice-chairman of the APC, Hon. Emma Enukwu to stop misleading Nigerians. DAILY POST reports that Enukwu, who is angling to become the Deputy National Chairman, South, of the party, was described as the sole-convener of the party in Enugu State. However, Ude, who did not take the assertion lightly, said Enukwu was turning history upside down just to realize his ambition. He described Enukwu as a blatant liar for claiming to be the sole-convener of the party. According to him, “Hon. Emma Enukwu should stop describing himself as the convener of the party in Enugu State, because four of us from CPC, ACN, ANPP and APGA formed the APC in Enugu State. “We had Comrade AC Ude, a National Officer in ACN, Chief Osita Okechukwu, National Officer in CPC, Hon Peter Okonkwo, APGA, and Hon Emma Enukwu, a National Officer in ANPP as the representatives of the legacy parties then from Enugu State “We contributed an equal amount of money each to make the merger stronger. “I was sent to Enugu to make arrangements for the final meeting as the youngest amongst them, which I did. “That was how we convened the first meeting of the APC in Enugu State, where all the leaders across the legacy parties met.” He called on Enukwu “to stop peddling lies on APC Enugu formation and accept his pending defeat, because he does not qualify to contest based on Enugu APC’s zoning arrangement.”
