Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje says the combination of legislative, judicial interventions and government reforms will address insecurity in Nigeria. Ganduje spoke on Friday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, at the 2022 Alumni Lecture of the University of Ibadan (UI), NAN reports. Ganduje, who attended the coronation of the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland, will on Saturday inaugurate a N250million ultra-modern hall in UI. In his lecture titled, ‘Challenges of Insecurity and Nation Building’, the Governor lamented the multiple security challenges the country was facing. He mentioned terrorism, banditry, kidnappings, drug trafficking, cybercrimes, robberies, weapons proliferation, human trafficking, communal clashes, ethnic nationalism and militancy. The Kano helmsman further listed hate speeches, economic and financial crimes, subversive activities, herdsmen/farmers clashes, youth unemployment and piracy. “Efforts to tackle insecurity can only be effective if there is a robust combination of legislative and judicial interventions with government reforms that address security challenges. “The formulation and effective implementation of policies and programmes capable of addressing the root causes of insecurity in Nigeria is crucial,” he stated. Ganduje called for modernization of security agencies, training, intelligence sharing, advanced technology, logistics, motivation and change of orientation. He advocated a complete overhaul of security institutions to reflect international standards of best practices. The Governor added that an institutionalized approach was better than the episodic and reactive response adopted by the government after attacks.
