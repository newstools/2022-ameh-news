Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has told President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently resign and hand over the presidency to his Vice, President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. The Governor made the call at a press conference in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, insisting that Buhari had failed in all areas of his electoral promises. Ortom noted that such a bold call from him to the Presidency could result in insults on his persons and vendetta against him, but maintained that the truth must be told. According to him, the Buhari-led government had completely failed Nigerians and “I want to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to accept the fact that he has failed this country and I want to advise him to honourably resign as president of Nigeria,” Ortom said. “Yes, he can resign and hand over to his deputy to handle the affairs of this country. Otherwise, this country will be going down,” he said. He further cried out that suspected Fulani herdsmen have continued to kill innocent Nigerians in his Local Government of Guma and other parts of Benue with the government doing nothing, not even reacting to such incidents. “They can insult me, send EFCC to come after me. If they come here, I will take you (EFCC) to court again, and by the grace of God, defeat you like I defeated you before,” he said.
