The New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, said the party has a brighter chance of winning election in the country in the coming 2023 general election. Jigawa State NNPP Chairman, Gambo Ibrahim Alawo stated this while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the State caucus meeting held at the party’s headquarters, in Dutse. He said the party is expecting to receive new members across the country due to the failure of the ruling APC and the PDP to wipe the tears of Nigerians. Alawo explained that the NNPP is ready to give every Nigerian chance to pursue their legitimate democratic rights in accordance with the party’s interest and Nigeria’s constitution. He advised those who have shown interest in joining the party to follow the legitimate way. “Over 300,000 people from both the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, as well as other parties will soon join our party in Jigawa State. “We are very delighted with the development and we are ready to welcome them into our great party. We promise to provide an enabling environment and treat them with justice and fairness,” he said. The chairman noted that looking at the present situation in the country, Nigerians needed a party that could solve the country’s problems and restore their confidence.
