Russia has announced that the first phase of its war with Ukraine is over. Russia said the first phase of its military plan is now complete, announcing that its next primary focus is now centered on eastern Ukraine. A top Russian general, Colonel General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia’s General Staff, said this in a Friday briefing, according to CNN. This is the first time Russia is giving some of the most detailed public remarks to date on its military strategy in neighbouring Ukraine “In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,” he said. “The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas. “The public and individual experts are wondering what we are doing in the area of the blockaded Ukrainian cities,” Rudskoy said. Rudskoy said military actions were carried out with the aim of destroying Ukraine’s military infrastructure, equipment and personnel in order, not only to stop Ukrainian forces from grouping in the Donbas, but also not to let them strengthen until the Russian forces have totally liberated the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. The DPR and LPR are separatist territories in eastern Ukraine that Russia recognized on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine.
