According to the association, following direct feedback from manufacturers, we recommend first and foremost that Government should create plausible incentives for investment in the development of raw materials locally through the Backward Integration and Resource based industrialization initiates. We recognize an urgent need for investment and production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) in the country; this should be adequately incentivized to encourage significant private investments.
