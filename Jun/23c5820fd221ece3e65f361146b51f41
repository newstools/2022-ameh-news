Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the New Life Community Care Initiative (NELCCI), and the Women Aid Collective, WACOL, have renewed their campaigns towards having many women occupy elective positions. At a 2-day sensitization workshop on voter’s education and women participation in politics, which was held at Obioma, in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, the groups said this was a time to change the status quo. In her speech, the Executive Director, New-Life Community Care Initiative (NELCCI) Florence Ifeanyi-Aneke emphasized the need for women to rise up to their civic rights. She said as the 2023 general elections approached, the women should be at the forefront of making sure that the right candidates were voted into office. “To achieve this, you must first of all obtain your voters’ cards; then make yourself part of the political process. A woman is eminently qualified to hold any elective position in Nigeria. “So, this time around, the women should be ready to support one of their own,” she advocated. She encouraged them “to support any woman that will contest in 2023, irrespective of the person`s party.” She added that “girls and women also have the right to vote in elections, be elected to government offices, school elections, serve on boards and make their voices heard in any process that will ultimately affect them, their families and their communities.” Meanwhile, members of the various political parties in Obioma said NELLCI’s advocacy program had deepened women involvement in political activities in the area. According to them, all the party executives of the APC, the PDP and the APGA, have good representation of women. They also disclosed that a woman from Obioma community, in the person of Chief Mrs. Oby Nwaofor, is the APC flagbearer for Enugu West Senatorial zone.
