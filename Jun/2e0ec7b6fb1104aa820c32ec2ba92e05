Former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has condemned the attack on innocent worshippers at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. Amaechi, in a statement by his media office on Sunday in Abuja, commiserated with the affected families, the church, the people of the Owo community and the Government of Ondo State. He described the incident as an absolutely vile and senseless murder of innocent citizens, adding that the security agencies should smoke out the monsters responsible for the barbaric act and punish them. Ameachi said, “I feel so sad that these criminals are so emboldened to carry out these barbaric attacks on the people in broad daylight. “Our security agencies have to put heads together and smoke out these monsters and ensure they are punished, immobilised and totally flushed out. “I pray for the families, the church, the people and the Government of Ondo state to find strength in the midst of the sorrow and pain.” Recall that the church was attacked on Sunday by yet to be identified gunmen, leading to the killing of scores of worshippers.
