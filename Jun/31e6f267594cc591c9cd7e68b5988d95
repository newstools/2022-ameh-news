The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has stated that the Federal Government will not be deterred in its efforts to ensure adequate security of lives and property of the citizenry. Aregbesola made this known during a visit to Owo on Monday in the wake of the attack and killing of worshipers at Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State by yet to be identified gunmen on Sunday. The Minister, who during his visit described the killing of the worshipers as devastating, senseless and an attempt to ignite ethnic war, added that the attack was executed to dampen the moral of the government and Owo community. He noted that the criminals were going after soft targets because they had been weakened. While commiserating with the Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin III on the attack, he called for collaborative efforts between traditional institutions and law enforcement agencies in arresting the fleeing criminals. At the premises of the church, Aregbesola told the parish priest, Rev. Fr. Andrew Abayomi, that it was worrisome that the attack occured in the South-West that has a measure of peace and tranquility. Aregbesola, while explaining that the security of lives and property of Nigerians remainded the number one agenda of the government, added that the government was doing everything possible to make the nation secured and peaceful. He said the Federal Government was outraged by the attack and will leave no stone unturned in getting to the root of it. “We must remain irrepressible and undeterred. We should not give the enemies the benefit of rejoicing over us. The attack was meant to dampen our morale and plunge us to gloom and darkness. “We must bounce back big time. But we should rise to defend our land and take our historic position in leading the black race to fulfilling its destiny,” the Minister concluded.
