They explained that local investors were increasing their stake in the equities market due to the attractive dividend yields in the market and because of the low yield environment in the fixed income market. They observed that the development was good for the local bourse, adding that it would restore credibility and stability to the market, which was hitherto marred by volatility occasioned by the activities of foreign investors.
