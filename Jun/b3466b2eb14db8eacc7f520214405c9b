Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has identified restructuring as the sole solution to the nation’s many problems, including insecurity. In his June 12 message, Akeredolu, who had postponed the State’s celebration of the day in honour of the victims of the June 5 attack at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, said it is time to enhance the democratic ideals that the day represents. The governor said Democracy Day is not just a deft stroke on the canvas of justice, but a reminder to all on the need to safeguard the principle of equality and fairness. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, he stated that the victims of the Owo attack will never be forgotten, describing it as an awful tragedy that had left many people with unhealed wounds in their hearts. “Although we are still mourning, we will not forget to join our voices to address the fundamental issues that have remained a clog in the wheel of the country’s progress. “The symbol of the June 12 struggle paid the supreme sacrifice. Our people must not continue to pay the ultimate price in vain. It is devastating. “Let us deepen our democratic values by devolving power to the sub-nationals. It will strengthen governance and make us stronger. “As we celebrate this year’s June 12, our mood in Ondo State is melancholic. Our hearts are still hurt. We are still in shock. Our loved ones who fell to the bullets of these terrorists will never be forgotten,” he said.
