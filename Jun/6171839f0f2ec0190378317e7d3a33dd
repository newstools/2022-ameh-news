Tension engulfed the Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, on Wednesday, as hoodlums invaded the premises to demand the corpse they earlier dumped at the morgue on Tuesday. It was gathered that the hoodlums, who arrived on motorcycles, had on Tuesday dumped the corpse of one of them killed in Osogbo at the hospital. They demanded that the corpse be released to them without any documentation. The crisis became intense when personnel they accosted told them they would have to fill some documents which made the thugs become infuriated at the point. The hoodlums, who openly displayed charms, also threatened to cause chaos unless the corpse was released to them. Many staff of the hospital, relatives with patients in the wards, out-patients and others that had business on the premises when the drama was ongoing, could be seen retreating from the area where the hoodlums had gathered to avoid being caught in the ensuing violence. Some armed police operatives later arrived at the hospital and forced the hoodlums out of the premises. When contacted for reaction, Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee of the Hospital, Dr. Babatunde Afolabi, stated that the matter has been contained. Afolabi revealed that a coroner inquest had been done on the corpse and the corpse had been retrieved for burial.
