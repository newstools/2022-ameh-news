A socio-political commentator, Reno Omokri, has said the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi would have been the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar’s running mate. Omokri said Obi’s defection from PDP to LP prevented him from being a “VP nominee.” In May 2022, Obi resigned from the leading opposition party. Obi said the developments within the PDP made it practically impossible for him to continue participating and making constructive contributions. Subsequently, the former Anambra State governor joined LP and emerged as the party’s presidential candidate. However, Omokri said he preferred Atiku to Obi. In an Instagram post, the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, expressed the belief that Obi has what it takes to make a good president. He was replying to a follower who accused him of not liking Obi. Omokri said: “Who told you I don’t support Peter Obi? Please ask him how he became HE Atiku’s vice in 2019. He is straightforward. He will not lie. I support Peter. “I believe he will make an excellent President. I have always maintained that and never wavered. However, I prefer Atiku to him. I wish he stayed in our party. He would have been the VP nominee.”
