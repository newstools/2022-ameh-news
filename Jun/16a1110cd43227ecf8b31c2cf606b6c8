The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on Tuesday, warned men of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Edo State Command, to shun acts capable of working against the Federal Government’s efforts to ensuring that Nigerians could procure international passports with ease. He said the ministry under his watch would not hesitate to deal with officials of the service engaged in any illegal dealings, noting that the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), was desirous of improving service delivery in the country. Aregbesola, who stated these on Tuesday at the official roll-out of the Enhanced e-Passport in Benin, Asaba and Warri as well as the commissioning of the Passport Office, said 10,000 e-passports were available on the platform for applicants and noted that the ministry was committed to changing the perception of service delivery for the better. “For our men who are quick to tell people that there are no passports just to exploit them, those who give unkind and harsh treatment to passport seekers will be dealt with henceforth. “President Buhari’s desire is to ensure that Nigerians get their international passport both home and abroad. So, what we are doing now is to remove all the obstacles,” the minister said. He added that the enhanced e-passport carries 25 additional security features and is rated to be among the best in the world in terms of durability and quality. The Acting Comptroller-General, Nigeria Immigration Service, Idris Jere, said with the unveiling in Edo, other states in the South-South have migrated to the enhanced e-passport.
