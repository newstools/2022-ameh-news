The 2023 presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, has said 70 percent of Nigerian politicians have no business in the leadership of the country and should be kicked out of power in the 2023 general elections. The former Anambra State Governor stated this on Sunday at the Men of Valour conference with the theme: “Navigating the corridors of power, the church, and the politics” organized by the Revival House of International Church (RHOGIC) in Abuja. Obi described politics in the country as a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum, stating that the system needs to be changed. According to Obi, some of the politicians in the corridors of power have no reason to be there. He said: “We can’t allow this gangsterism to continue, Nigerians should take back their country. 70 percent of those who are in politics today should not have any reason to be there. “I have said it, politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum.”
