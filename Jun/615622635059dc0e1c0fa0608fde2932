The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) that comprised of 400 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of member-companies across the six geo-political zones and Sectoral Groups has disclosed that electricity supply to the manufacturing industries from the national grid showed increased improvement in the second half of 2021. According to the report Average daily supply of electricity has been stable at 11 hours and power outage, three times per day respectively. http://www.manufacturersassociatin.org Consequently, it further disclosed that the expenditure on alternative energy source dipped to N45.04 billion in the half under review from N57.75 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2020; thus, indicating N12.71 billion or 22.0 percent decline over the period.   However, report said it increased by N12.86 billion or 40.0 percent when compared with N32.18 billion of the preceding half. Expenditure on alternative energy totaled N71.22 billion in 2021 as against N81.91 billion of the 2020.   “The Manufacturing sector recorded a growth rate of 2.28 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 which revealed an increase of 3.79 point when compared with -1.51 percent recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020. However, the sector’s performance contracted by 2.01 point in comparison to 4.29 percent recorded in the preceding quarter of 2021. http://www.amehnews.com “The positive performance recorded in the manufacturing sector in year 2021 is attributed to the palliative measures imposed by Government to salvage the sector from the effect of Covid 19 pandemic.  Nevertheless, the report said to improve and reposition the sector back as the engine of growth, there is need to maintain those policies and formulate others that will encourage investments especially on the stability of exchange rate, development of local raw materials, protection of lives and properties among others.  NBS analysis of sectoral imports in the fourth quarter of 2021 also showed that import of manufactured goods was N3000.66 billion; Raw-material goods was N543.87 billion; Agricultural products was N667.16 billion and Solid mineral import amounted to N29.81 billion in the quarter. The share of manufactured goods import to total import was 50.51 percent, Raw-Material goods and Agricultural products were 9.16 percent and 11.23 percent respectively.  Advertiwsement  Although, the report further noted that the electricity supply from the national grid has marginally improved since 2019 as indicated by the average daily electricity supply and outage. Notwithstanding however, electricity supply from the grid has persistently been inadequate, compelling manufacturers to invest heavily in alternative energy sources to sustain uninterrupted production activity.  “While some of them have invested in diesel generating plants, some others are utilizing gas plan adding that the costs associated with these plants are further increased by expenditure on spare parts and other energy management apparatuses such as stabilizers, UPSs, and Inverters.  Unfortunately, it said the cumulative expenditure on these alternative energy sources and the high tariff associated with supplies from the national grids majorly account for the high cost of production in the sector. With the share of energy standing at a colossal 40 percent.  According to report, expenditure on alternative energy source in the manufacturing sector stood at N45.04 billion in the second half of 2021 as against N57.75 billion recorded in the corresponding half of 2020; thus, indicating N12.71 billion or 22 percent declined over the period.  However, it increased by N12.86 billion when compared with N32.18 billion recorded in the preceding half. Expenditure on alternative energy sources stood at N77.22 billion in 2021 as against 81.91 billion recorded in 2020.  Th decline in expenditure on alternative energy sources in 2021 was ascribed to the marginal improvement in the national electricity supply over the period, it added.
