“Continuation of Contributor Data Recapture Exercise by PFAs” The National Pension Commission (PenCom) have invite all Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders to visit any branch of their Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to participate in the ongoing Data Recapture Exercise (DRE). According to the statement sent to The AmehNews said the exercise is for both active contributors and retirees whose data have not been recaptured. “The DRE is in compliance with the directive of the Federal Government that all data generating organisations should harmonise their databases with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). It is also consistent with the need to have a credible database of all RSA holders in Nigeria. Consequently, the report added that all active contributors are hereby advised to visit their PFAs and provide the following documents to complete the data recapture:
i. Staff Identity Card or any one of the following:
• National Driver’s License; or
• Permanent Voter’s Card; or
• International Passport (mandatory for non-Nigerians).
ii.Enrollment Slip issued by NIMC
iii. Birth Certificate or Sworn Affidavit of Age Declaration. http://www.pencom.gov.ng For retirees, the statement further disclosed that who are either on programmed withdrawal or annuity, they are expected to present the following documents:
