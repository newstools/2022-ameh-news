The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), Thursday, accused the Authority of National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), of preparing Examination timetable covering
Jumu‘ah prayers. It also said the arrangement was to force Muslim candidates to write examinations under duress and compel Muslim invigilators to work in a dehumanizing condition. MURIC also demanded an unreserved apology from NOUN for subjecting the Muslim candidates and staff to an alleged immeasurable psychological trauma, which it said would affect their performance during the examinations. The MURIC Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola disclosed this in a statement made available  in Abuja. The Islamic group also demanded for the cancellation of all examination papers scheduled for the Jumu‘ah period on Friday, 6 and Friday, May 13, 2022. The group, while describing the timetable as anti-Muslim and neo-imperialist, said it was an infringement on Allah-given fundamental rights of the Muslim students and staff. In his words, “For those who may be wondering what is wrong if Muslim students and staff are made to write and invigilate examinations during the Jumu‘ah period on Friday, it is akin to compelling Christian students and staff to write examinations and to invigilate on Sunday mornings.”
