We need to rediscover those days”, he stated. The Air Peace boss, who was recognised with the Alumnus of the Year Award by the University in 2019, used the medium to plead with the Academic Staff Union of Universities,  ASUU,  to call off their strike for the sake of the nation and the wellbeing of the students. He said, “it pains me that our children have been at home for several months. For the sake of our nation, which is passing through trying times, and for the sake of the wellbeing of our children, ASUU should, please, call off the strike. He said the Federal Government and the Union should reach an amicable decision to end the crisis in the country’s university system. Explaining how the Airline Operators of Nigeria, AON, suspended its planned shutdown of operations last Sunday, the aviator stated that the operators made sacrifices to give room for the government to solve the issue and it had done that. He asked ASUU to take a cue from what the airlines did by sacrificing for the wellbeing of Nigerian students. The airline helmsman also harped on the need for Nigerians to leverage their diversity for national development. In his words: “Nigeria has the potential. Let’s explore this potential. The bigger Nigeria is, the stronger we should be because there’s strength in diversity”. He implored well-meaning Nigerians to inculcate the culture of giving back to their alma mater and be involved in its development. Lauding the UIAA President, Professor Elsie Adewoye, for her hardwork in bringing to fruition the new guest house , Onyema added that people like her should be recognised by Nigerian government. He challenged her to make good use of the influence of personalities like the Sultan and John Odigie to attract more investments to the University.

Thank you most exceedingly”. Speaking, the Sultan of Sokoto, His Royal Majesty, Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar, charged the school management to never let the school down. “Government cannot do it all.
