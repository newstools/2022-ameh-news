Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka, on Sunday paid a visit to Yoruba Nation campaigner, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho. Soyinka’s media office in a statement confirmed the visit, with a picture showing Igboho with the Nobel laureate and leader of Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Banji Akintoye. Details of the meeting could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report. Soyinka’s visit is coming weeks after the release of Igboho in Benin Republic. Recall that Igboho was declared wanted by the Department of State Services (DSS), after the agency allegedly found arms at his residence. He was arrested by the Interpol at a Benin airport on July 19, 2021, while boarding a flight to Germany after he fled his Ibadan residence. Igboho was released on health grounds after spending about nine months in a detention facility in Benin Republic. Igboho is agitating for the actualisation of the Yoruba nation.
