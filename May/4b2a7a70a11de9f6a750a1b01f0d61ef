Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, have been urged to step down their presidential ambitions. Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based activist, said Osinbajo and Tinubu should step down in favour of the South-East. He was reacting to calls that the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, should zone their presidential tickets to the South. The rights activist said such calls were a waste of time. In a Facebook post, Adeyanju stressed that such calls would only unite the North. According to Adeyanju: “The protests demanding for Southern presidency at both APC and PDP secretariats are a waste of time. It will only unite the North. “The best way to ensure South gets presidency is for Tinubu, Osinbajo and others to step down their ambition for South-East in the interest of equity.”
