Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has called for an end to the bloodletting in the South-East. Kanu said he was saddened by the reports of killings across the South-East. He expressed his displeasure from the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, in Abuja on Monday evening, while hosting his brother, Prince Emmanuel Kanu. Emmanuel said the IPOB leader was “saddened by the reports of killings across the South-East. “My brother does not believe in bloodshed and felt too bad that bloodsuckers had been on the prowl in the South-East almost unchallenged,” he told Vanguard. The IPOB leader said all those responsible for the insecurity in the region should be held accountable for their atrocities. According to Kanu, Igbos are not known for cannibalism. Lately, the activities of unknown gunmen in the Southeast have been on the rise. A few weeks ago, unknown gunmen killed military officers heading for their marriage rites in Imo State. Last week, a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Okechukwu Okoye was also beheaded by unknown gunmen.
