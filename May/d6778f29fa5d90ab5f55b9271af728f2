Dame Pauline Tallen, Minister of Women Affairs, has dropped her senatorial ambition. Tallen made this known in a statement she issued on Monday. The minister had purchased the All Progressives Congress (APC) form to contest the Plateau South Senatorial election. According to her, after consultations with her constituents, she has decided to withdraw from the race. The statement read in part: “I remain resolute as I continue to relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian Women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. “Consequently, I wish to inform you all that following broad-based consultations and interventions from critical stakeholders, I have decided to withdraw from running for the senatorial seat, mindful of our accomplishments and the notable progress we have recorded under my stewardship at the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.”
