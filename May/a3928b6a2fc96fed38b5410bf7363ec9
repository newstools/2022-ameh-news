Speaking with THISDAY, the vice president, Highcap securities limited, Mr. David Adnori explained that as investors’ appetite grew, the prices of stocks kept pushing up, hence the reason the prices of stocks were high in April. According to him, “Also, April saw the influx of Q1 2022 numbers which were impressive. We have seen Airtel Africa, Zenith Bank, UBA, and Dangote Cement reporting decent increase in profit after tax (PAT) and we saw investors scrambling to make sure they qualify for the dividends and so I think that sentiment should continue even in the new month. “I think we might see a bit of caution on the part of investors because we are not expecting any of the major Q1 2022 earnings and so even if we see a bit of rally, it will be just a few stocks that investors are betting on do pretty well on the back of Q1 numbers especially for those that pay interim dividends.” The chief operating officer, InvestData Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion noted that most listed companies are currently undervalued over the effect of COVID-19, stressing that local and foreign investors opted to take positions in April. On market outlook, analysts at Afrinvest Limited said, “Although we expect the positive sentiment from dividend payments to linger into early May, we think the market might begin to enter a quiet mood in the later part of the month.”
