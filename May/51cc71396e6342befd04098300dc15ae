It has the highest exposure to stock among the Funds under the Multifund structure, meaning that a higher percentage of Fund I is invested in buying shares of companies compared to other funds. If you have requested to be moved to Fund I, you should pay particular attention to the performance of Fund I but also constantly have a look at the performance of Fund II to be sure you made a right choice moving to Fund I.  Fund II is the default fund under the Multifund structure for RSA holders who are below 50 years old. If you are below 50 years old and you have not specifically requested that your PFA should move you to Fund I, then you will be in Fund II. You should pay particular attention to the performance of Fund II but you should also monitor the performance of Fund I to assist you in deciding whether to move to Fund I or not.  Fund III is default Fund for RSA holders who are 50 years & above but have not retired. Multifund structure gives PFAs the right to move anybody who is 50 years & above from Fund II to Fund III but the law also allows you to request to be moved back to Fund II if you choose to. If you are 50 years & above and you have not requested to be moved back to Fund II, then you will be in Fund III. You should pay attention to the performance of Fund III and keep an eye on the performance of Fund II to enable you decide whether to move back to Fund II.  Fund IV is the Retiree Fund with the lowest exposure to equity. All RSA holders that have retired are automatically moved to Fund IV and Retirees cannot move to other Funds.
