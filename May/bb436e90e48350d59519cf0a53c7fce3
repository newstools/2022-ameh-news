Embattled former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, on Monday asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to declare the invasion of his residence by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission illegal and unconstitutional. Okorocha, who is the lawmaker representing Imo West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, also demanded N1bn damages from the Federal Government for the May 24, 2022 invasion of his Abuja residence. The EFCC and Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), were listed as first and second respondents at the fundamental human rights enforcement suit filed by a constitutional lawyer and human rights activist, Dr. Mike Ozekhome (SAN). With the engagement of the services of Ozekhome, Okorocha now has five Senior Advocates of Nigeria to defend him. Ozekhome’s suit came some hours after his appearance before a Federal High Court in Abuja where he pleaded not guilty to the N2.9bn corruption charges brought against him by the EFCC. Ozekhome wants a declaration that the siege on Okorocha’s residence at No.3 Nyasa Close, Mississippi, off Ontario Crescent on May 24 2022, without any legal justification, thereby denying him his constitutional right to privacy, was illegal. He also wants an order of the court directing the respondents to tender apology in at least three national newspapers.
