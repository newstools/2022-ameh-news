The Independent National Electoral Commission on Tuesday said that 11 political parties would take part in Saturday’s bye- election in the Ngor Okpala Local Government Area of Imo state. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in the State, Francis Ezeonu, said that the commissioner was ready for the bye-election. The state House of Assembly had declared the seat vacant citing the inability of the former occupant, Tochi Okereke, to perform his legislative duties. Briefing journalists at the Commission’s secretariat in Owerri, Ezeonu disclosed that a total number of 94, 040 voters are to vote in 193 polling units in the LGA. The don said that the commission would be engaging about 800 ad hoc staff, including senior polling officers, polling officers and assistant polling officers. He said that all electoral materials had arrived in the state, adding that all non-sensitive materials had been supplied to Ngor Okpala and completely batched ready for deployment. The INEC REC said, “The sensitive materials are in the Central Bank of Nigeria and would be deployed from Thursday February 24 according to Operational order provided. “On Friday men and materials will be moved to the RACs, while on the election day deployment starts by 5 am.”
