…. we are addressing issues, mgt  BY JOHN OKOH All is not well at one of the foremost airlines in the country, Aero contractor as workers have poised for a showdown with the management of the airline over issues bordering on welfare and running of the airline since AMCON took over Investigation by correspondent revealed that embattled workers were fed up with the system as being operated by the management without consideration for them. According to anonymous workers interviewed last during their congress at the airport, the management of Aero contractors has suspended their conditions of service It was also learned that since the arrival of two Airbus aircraft owned by some individuals into the fleet of Aero, the airlines fortune has continued to dwindled as revenue (air fare) generated was paid into the individuals accounts while Aero was left with nothing. According to sources since the arrival of the Airbus, the management of the airline has withdrawn aero’s aircraft B737 from its hitherto lucrative routes like Sokoto, Abuja and Portharcourt and replaced it with the Airbus “Before the arrival of the Airbus, it was agreed that they will be deployed on Maiduguri route which was activated but when it arrived, the aircraft started competing with our Aero aircraft on our lucrative routes, collecting our passengers and revenue and remitting fares from only three seats of an aircraft of almost 200 capacity” “Can you imagine, with all the money made last year during the festive period, the management claimed they was no money. As I speak with you, we have not been paid January salary” “They collect N35,000 airfare, passengers booked and unfortunately, one of their aircraft (Airbus) had an issue and could not fly, they used Aero B737 aircraft to ferry passengers, made huge amount and paid themselves while the workers are lamenting” The workers threatened to embark on strike Monday if the Aero management failed to address the workers welfare adding that the committee set up to looking into their welfare has since submitted their report and the management refused to act on it. The workers also alleged that the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) was threatening them of shutting down the airline should they go ahead with their strike. But in a swift response, the AMCON Spokesperson, Jude Nwauzor dismissed the allegation of shutting down the airline Meanwhile, the Managing Director of Aero contractors, Capt Abdullahi Zubair Mahmood while reacting to allegations raised by workers explained that workers welfare remained paramount in his line of activity Mahmoud said the Aero contractors like other airlines was passing through hard times as a result of the economic situation in the country especially with the FOREX issue. On delay in salary payment, the Aero boss said, that the management informed workers that there will be delay in January salary payment as the airline had it tough during the festive period as they had issues with their machines that led to flight cancelations and the airline made refund to passengers He however explained that over 70 percent of the workers have received their salaries and that it was ongoing and assured them of amicable resolution of all issues According to him, the airline will bounce back soon as some of their aircraft were being worked on to commence operations
