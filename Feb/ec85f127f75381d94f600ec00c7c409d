Ogun, Oyo, Ibadan, Osun and Kwara Regions will experience prolonged power outages in the coming week, DAILY POST learnt. This, it was gathered, was due to the low generation, and low power allocation to the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company, IBEDC’s network by Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). On a weekly average, the IBEDC, as it was learnt, receives 692.5MW power allocation from TCN. Meanwhile, IBEDC in a statement made available to DAILY POST by the Regional Communication Officer, Kikelomo Owoeye on Friday said the distribution company had 368.5MW compared to the 692.5MW power allocation expected. According to her, “most of the power generation companies that are using hydro (water) cannot generate adequately. So, gas is the only way out. Only generation companies that are using gas are functioning. “Due to low generation, the weekly average power allocation to our network by TCN was 368.5MW compared to the 692.5MW expected. “Kindly bear with us as we work with stakeholders in the electricity value chain on a sustainable resolution. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.”
