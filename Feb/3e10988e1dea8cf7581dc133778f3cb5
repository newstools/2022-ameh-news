Nestlé Nigeria launched “Nestlé Empowering Rural Women in Nigeria project” which aims to help rural women retailers within the company’s value chain scale up their businesses to increase their household incomes. The program was recently launched in Nsukka and Obolo-Afor, both in Enugu State to reach an additional 50 women retailers. This brings the number of beneficiaries to 150.
