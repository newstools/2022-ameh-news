In support of the activities of the Lagos Chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) donated office equipment to the Lagos NIPR secretariat. Speaking at the presentation held at the Chapter’s secretariat in Ilupeju on Thursday February 24, 2022, the outgoing General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, noted that the donation will go a long way to enhance the administrative prowess of the chapter. The General Manager, who will officially retire from the service of FAAN on Friday February 25, 2022 noted that being a member of the Lagos Chapter “has been fantastic and rewarding”. Receiving the donation on behalf of the Chapter, Mrs. Comfort Obot Nwankwo, the Lagos NIPR Chairman, expressed delight over the kind gesture. The Chairman of the foremost Chapter called on other members of the Institute in Lagos to emulate the kind gesture of the Institute’s members in FAAN. “As the Lagos Chapter’s secretariat undergoes a major facelift, I want to encourage our members to join us in making this task a reality,” she said. “We still need the assistance of individuals and corporate organisations. Prospective donors need not give us the money. They may decide to purchase any other office equipment, office furniture, that are needed. The list of the items needed are available on request.” The office equipment donated by FAAN are: • AP Sharp 6023NV Copier
• Lenovo A10 C15 4LiTB all-in-one desktop computer
