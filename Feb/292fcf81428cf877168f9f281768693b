As 2023 elections draw closer, erstwhile President, Olusegun Obasanjo has urged the older generation to step down for the younger ones. Obasanjo said the older generation should support the younger generation with the needed knowledge and experience to transform Nigeria. The former President spoke yesterday at the 2022 annual lecture of the Murtala Muhammed Foundation. He faulted old politicians still contesting for the Presidency in 2023. According to Obasanjo: “We need to have an intergenerational collaboration. Fayemi said he was in primary school when Murtala and Obasanjo were there. “So, if people of the Murtala/Obasanjo era are competing with you as Governor, then, something is wrong. “The Murtala/Obasanjo group should be stepping aside. “Whatever experience and knowledge we have, we should be able to give it to you and you should be able to give it to those coming after you.”
