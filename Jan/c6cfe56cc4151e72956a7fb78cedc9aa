The 2018 feeding futures Africa Workshop (AGROCONNECT) held in Lagos, Nigeria” The NiMet boss said the objective of the partnership was to engage stakeholders on their role in co-production and co-ownership of Agrometeorological products for effective understanding and efficient utilisation of the products as promoted by NiMet and the WMO stressing that if also affords NiMet a platform to develop a sustainable communication channel to the end-users and appreciate further the needs from stakeholders.
